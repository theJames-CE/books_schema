In the previous chapter, you created the books_schema. Now, you'll get the chance to forward engineer this schema, and use queries to manipulate the database. Imagine you're in charge of maintaining a database of users and books for an online book retailer. In this role, you need to manage the data that is displayed, including the books each user has favorited, the all the users that have favorited a particular book.<br>

If you get stuck on retrieving, changing, or deleting users, books, and favorites, be sure to apply the 20 minute rule! Try re-reading the previous modules and doing research on your own, then reaching out to your peers, and finally setting up some time with a Coding Dojo staff member so that you talk through the challenge you're facing.<br>
